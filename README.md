# Daily-Routine-Board
Kanban-style boards in Backlog are a handy feature to visualize and organize our work.It provides a visual representation of tasks and their statuses. Generally, the statuses are ‘To Do,’ ‘In Progress,’ and ‘Done’ etc. This is useful for keeping everyone updated about pending tasks, work progress.

### How It Works
Our board has four stauses which are 'Backlog', 'Progress', 'Complete' and 'On Hold'. It relies on a 'Drag and Drop' functionalities of working. Each task (represented by a card) is dragged from the ‘Backlog’ column and dropped to 'Progress' and its status is updated by progressing the card through the columns until it’s ‘Complete.’ This process is repeated for all tasks.All the tasks of different columns are stored in localstorage. Initially it is filled by some sample tasks.
